# SI²A: Shadow IT Incident Autopilot 🚀
## BigQuery AI - Building the Future of Data

### Project Title
**SI²A (Shadow IT Incident Autopilot)** - AI-Powered Security Incident Triage Using BigQuery's Cutting-Edge AI Capabilities

### Problem Statement
Security teams are drowning in unstructured evidence from multiple sources (CASB/SaaS logs, support emails, screenshots, PDFs, policy documents) and struggling with slow, inconsistent incident response. Traditional approaches require manual swivel-chair integration across multiple tools, leading to 4-8 hour Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), inconsistent triage quality, policy drift, and knowledge silos where past incident solutions are not easily discoverable. The challenge is to transform this messy, multi-format data into intelligent, automated incident triage that feels like an extension of SQL, not a separate system.

### Impact Statement
**SI²A delivers measurable business transformation:**
- **40% MTTR Reduction**: From 4-8 hours to 2.4-4.8 hours per incident
- **15% Resolution Rate Improvement**: Better first-touch resolution through semantic knowledge retrieval
- **Automated Compliance**: Zero manual policy checking required, preventing policy drift
- **Instant Knowledge Access**: Semantic search surfaces relevant past solutions in seconds
- **Proactive Threat Detection**: AI-powered forecasting identifies emerging patterns
